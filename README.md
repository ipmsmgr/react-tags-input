# react-tags-input

`react-tags-input` us a simple React component for creating input tags. It began as a fork off of [olahol/react-tagsinput](https://github.com/olahol/react-tagsinput), I began to port over features from [bootstrap-tagsinput](https://github.com/bootstrap-tagsinput/bootstrap-tagsinput).

## Installation

The easiest way to use `react-tags-input` is to install it from NPM and include it in your React build process (using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), etc).

```bash
npm install react-tags-input --save
```

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-tags-input.js` and `dist/react-tags-input.css` in your page. If you do this, make sure you already included the following dependencies:

* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [classNames](http://jedwatson.github.io/classnames/)
* [object-assign](https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign)

## Usage

Take a look at the the examples in the Examples section; they should give a good impression of what `ReactTagsInput` can do, and the source code of the examples is probably the fastest way to learn how to use `ReactTagsInput`.

## CSS stylesheet

I've built a default stylesheet, `dist/react-tags-input.css`, that you may include in your site/project. 

You can customize the styles by modifying the stylesheet itself or by using [less](http://lesscss.org/) and modifying the less files in the `/less` directory.
